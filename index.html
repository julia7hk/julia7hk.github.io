	<h3>Drawing and Coloring</h3>
	<p>I like to draw, but I don't do it often. I like to draw 3D symetrical objects because they are real objects that i can draw easily. I also like to draw cute cartoon-ish animals with cute faces. I sometimes draw using pencil and paper, but I also use my Ipad and pencil to draw digitally.</p>
	<p>When it comes to coloring, I like to use colored pencils and markers. My mom finds coloring sheets and puts them into a book so it is like our own personalized coloring book. I rarely color, but it still lets me relax and have fun. My favorite colors are light blues and pinks. In general, I like most colors if they are pastel because they make me feel happy with the soft colors.</p>
	<h3>Hanging Out with Friends</h3>
	<p>I like to have friends to have around me to keep me company.</p>
